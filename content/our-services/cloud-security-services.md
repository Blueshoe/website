::::GlobalTitle{.mb-6}
What is cloud-native security?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
When you have cloud applications working together, it’s easy to overlook policy misconfigurations. Simple misconfiguration can leave your organization with vulnerabilities not easily detectable by automation or tooling.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
Cloud security is a comprehensive set of technology, methodology, and procedures that tackle internal and external threats to your organization’s security. Top cloud providers have gone to great lengths to ensure cloud application security by default. Most cloud security gaps occur when customers are not implementing adequate security across their own policies and practices.
::::
::::GlobalTitle{:size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
Why is cloud security important?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Cloud security ensures your data—and your customers’ data—is not accessible to unauthorized users. If your business is subject to compliance programs like the GDPR, SOC 2, or HIPAA, cloud security is crucial to maintaining your compliance status, avoiding large fines, and being able to do business at all.

::::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" .mb-6}
What does a secure cloud environment look like?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" .mb-4}
Security in cloud computing has a few important pillars:
::::
#label-1
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Identity and access management (IAM)
::
#text-1
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
This addresses which users can access what parts of the cloud stack, and what they can do with that access. IAM ensures bad actors do not gain unauthorized access to systems using legitimate credentials. It also ensures that trusted people don’t have more access than necessary. IAM includes:
::
::GlobalBlock{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .leading-6 .mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Password security
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Least privilege rules
- Real-time behavior and credential monitoring
::
#label-2
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Secure compute layer
::
#text-2
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Protect against the spread of malware and ensure your systems remain available and functional. This includes:
::
::GlobalBlock{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .leading-6 .mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Up-to-date patches and service packs
- Misconfiguration detection
- Secure login
- Firewall rules across north-south and east-west traffic
- Hardened images from trusted sources
::
#label-3
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Storage security
::
#text-3
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Ensure your data buckets remain intact and accessible. Secure storage looks like:
::
::GlobalBlock{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .leading-6 .mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Centralized storage permissions
- Proper asset and data classification
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Versioning and access logs
- Real-time misconfiguration monitoring

Cloud services security
::
#text-4
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Protect your services in the cloud by:
::
::GlobalBlock{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .leading-6 .mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Identifying redundant storage solutions
- Engaging in regular security testing
- Enable antivirus programs, encryption controls, and firewalls
- Automatically analyzing static code and conducting dependency scans
- Implement standard application security layers
- Enforce best practices throughout the organisation

Indicators of secure, reliable cloud providers
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
Searching for reliable cloud providers on your own is a lengthy process. Blueshoe has vetted hundreds of cloud providers so businesses know that any provider recommendations are reliable and secure. Here are important metrics and indicators to assess:
::::
#card1
::GlobalListCardWithImage{:src="/img/global/icons/24-hours_1.svg"}
:::GlobalTitle{:size="sm" :tag="h4" .mb-4}
Availability
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
Many of the largest, most trusted cloud service providers promise at least 99.9% availability, which is about 9 hours of downtime every year.
:::
::
#card2
::GlobalListCardWithImage{:src="/img/global/icons/handshake.svg"}
:::GlobalTitle{:size="sm" :tag="h4" .mb-4}
Reliability
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
When there’s downtime, how fast is it rectified? 99% reliability is typical and translates to about 3.5 days of yearly downtime.
:::
::
#card3
::GlobalListCardWithImage{:src="/img/global/icons/cyber-security.svg"}
:::GlobalTitle{:size="sm" :tag="h4" .mb-4}
Security
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
Security has many categories. Ensure cloud providers account for network, access control, cloud infrastructure, and data security.
:::
::
#card4
::GlobalListCardWithImage{:src="/img/global/icons/router.svg"}
:::GlobalTitle{:size="sm" :tag="h4" .mb-4}
Data breach policies
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
If your cloud vendor is breached, transparency is key. Vendors should have policies in place to address a breach and clearly outline their data breach response procedures.
:::
::
#card5
::GlobalListCardWithImage{:src="/img/global/icons/chameleon.svg"}
:::GlobalTitle{:size="sm" :tag="h4" .mb-4}
Adaptability
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
If you have a hybrid and/or distributed workforce, you need cloud products that ensure business continuity. Ensure their security features will protect your data wherever employees are working.

Cloud security services and cloud migration
::::
::::GlobalTitle{:size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
Stay secure when migrating to the cloud
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Migrating from legacy systems to the cloud does come with some security risks. Here are some of the key considerations for your cloud migration strategy:
::::
::::GlobalBlock{.mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Learn how or if you can refactor applications instead of hastily rehosting
- Ensure your company’s security policies are appropriate for a cloud environment
- Brush up on data residency requirements and data privacy laws in every relevant country
- Select a provider that will encrypt your data at rest and in transit
- Plan for monitoring tools for your infrastructure, platform and software as a service environments
- Consider vulnerability management tools for end-host operating systems, container, and serverless services
- Confirm that your intended cloud service provider will support required compliance standards and ensure cloud workloads, data, and access are secure
- Back up your data in case you encounter errors during data transfer
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
These are just some of the considerations organizations face when migrating to the cloud. Blueshoe has helped numerous organizations through this process. We can lead you through every stage of planning and implementation to ensure your cloud migration is a technical and business success.

We built a whole platform and infrastructure for automated seminar and webinar management. Including consent management, connection to existing systems, interfaces to external applications such as Go2Webinar, access management via Keycloak and monitoring dashboards . All of it is built on a service based architecture and runs on Kubernetes. The whole platform runs on highly automated processes for development and deployment.
