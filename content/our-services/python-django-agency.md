Why do we trust in Python and Django?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-3}
Developing good web applications poses a new challenge time and time again. In the front end, the application has to be responsive while in the back end, the code needs to be implemented in a structured, readable and maintainable manner. At the same time, you’re facing individual client wishes and requests. New possibilities and technologies change rapidly. **Flexibility and extensibility** are therefore major topics when it comes to software development – just as important as **data security**.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Our agency for cloud native development in Munich helps you to meet these standards and to implement individual wishes. Unlike many of our competitors, however, we don’t rely on PHP when implementing our projects. Instead, we trust in the programming language Python and the web framework Django. These two technologies are much better suited to **solid and future-oriented** software.

The problem with PHP
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Even if PHP has so far been used a fair bit as a programming language for web applications, its popularity has been decreasing for a few years now. PHP currently still has quite a large market share and this can be primarily explained by two factors: it’s fairly cheap and has been used for server-side implementations for a long time. For all its maturity, therein lies one of PHP’s biggest flaws: the language wasn’t designed well and resembles an accumulation of functions rather than a well-thought-out concept.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
As a result, working with PHP requires fairly little training comparatively, but the **maintenance costs** are all the higher. Applications that can be flexibly adjusted to new trends and are extensible at the same time, can therefore not be implemented anymore in this way. That’s why **Blueshoe trusts in a different programming language – namely, Python.**

Programming in Python
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
For the development of software, Python is the better option. This language is efficient, fast and allows for a modular structure. Python’s syntax is based on indentations rather than curly brackets. This forces the developer to structure the code, which, in turn, guarantees good readability. And once the code is easier to read, maintenance costs are reduced, programming errors can be found and removed more quickly and new developers can be trained in less time.

The django Framework
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
One of Django’s development goals is the fast implementation of data models through object-relational mapping (ORM) and a flexible web design using HTML templates. Django prevents various different risks and attack strategies like cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting or SQL injection. With other languages and frameworks, programmers have to sort out this protection themselves. Particularly in larger projects, this can quickly lead to security gaps and an enormous amount of additional work.

Well-known web applications like Instagram and Pinterest were created using Django. Due to the large community, there is also a large pool of useful packages available (more than 3000) to speed up the development of new features significantly. What’s more, the helpfulness and friendliness among the community members is simply unique.

Our approach
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Those who want to develop excellent software have to do a lot of things right. And this fundamentally requires a plan. Our development philosophy reflects what we have learnt in both smaller and very large projects – and our clients appreciate our commitment for every project.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
We don’t regard ourselves as simple yeasayers and therefore don’t just implement. We want to actively help you to achieve the best possible results for your endeavours. In web development, the tendency is to deal with small problems by using complex methods of resolution. People tend to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. That’s not our way. We love pragmatism.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
We know that requirements can change during the development process and that a sudden change of direction may sometimes be necessary. We want the final result to comply with your vision in every detail. That’s why we work transparently, do frequent checks and discuss regularly.
