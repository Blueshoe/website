::::
#card1
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4 }
Reduce costs
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
Cloud infrastructure means you pay only for what you use and require no upfront costs. That means no more hardware purchases, servers, administration, power consumption, air conditioning, upgrades, defects, or additional operational costs.
::
#card2
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4}
Scale faster
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
Instead of being bound to rigid applications, being cloud native allows you flexibility based on user demand. Request for more compute power? Not even needed; it happens automatically through auto-scalling configurations.
::
#card3
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4}
Improve reliability
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
Cloud providers have the team strength to achieve high reliability and uptime. With robust infrastructure teams, cloud providers have all the resources and expertise you need without you having to internally support a new team or on-site resources.
