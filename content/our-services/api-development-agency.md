Why do we need APIs
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Many applications require some kind of application programming interface (API), which enables communication with internal or external services/applications. In contrast to user interfaces, APIs connect servers and software components with each other. Thus, often they are not actively perceived by end users, as there is no direct interaction. However, APIs play an important role in modern application architectures, such as microservices architecture, as they can definitely impact the overall user experience. Most applications, even seemingly small and medium sized ones, are by fact distributed systems that communicate over networks. This communication using APIs is of utmost importance for the development of functioning applications.

LET'S DEVELOP YOUR API FIRST STRATEGY
::::
::::GlobalTitle{size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
Welcome to the API first approach!
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
An API first strategy is an approach to software development that prioritizes the creation of an Application Programming Interface (API) before any other aspect of the application. This strategy allows developers to create a consistent, unified interface for different components of the application, making it easier to maintain and extend functionality. Additionally, this strategy encourages developers to focus on creating robust APIs that are well documented and easy to use.

Are you looking for a way to quickly and easily build web applications?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
The API first approach is the perfect solution for you. By using an API First approach, you can create powerful, secure web applications in a fraction of the time it takes with traditional development methods. The API first approach is a modern approach to web application development that focuses on designing and developing APIs before writing any code. This approach makes it easier to develop applications quickly and securely by separating the backend logic from the frontend design. By separating the two, developers can focus on creating robust APIs that are easy to use and maintain while designers can focus on creating an attractive user interface.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Using an API First Approach also allows developers to create applications that are more scalable and secure. By separating the backend logic from the frontend design, developers can ensure that their application is secure against malicious attacks while still providing a smooth user experience. Additionally, this approach allows developers to quickly add new features or scale up existing ones as needed without having to re-write code or make major changes. If you're looking for a way to quickly develop powerful web applications, then look no further than the API First approach. With its focus on security, scalability, and ease of use, this approach is perfect for any developer looking to create robust web applications in record time!

::::GlobalTitle{.mb-6}
What API technologies should I use?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
There are many different types of APIs available, including web APIs, mobile APIs, and cloud APIs. Web APIs allow developers to access data and services from websites and web applications. Mobile APIs allow developers to access data and services from mobile devices. Cloud APIs allow developers to access data and services from cloud-based applications.
::::
#label-1
::GlobalTitle{:size="md" :tag="h4"}
What technologies do cloud APIs use?
::
#text-1
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .leading-6}
Cloud APIs typically use a combination of technologies, such as Representational State Transfer (REST), Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC), GraphQL, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). These technologies allow developers to access data and services from cloud-based applications.
::

::GlobalTitle{:size="md" :tag="h4"}
How do REST APIs work?
::
#text-2
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .leading-6}
REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a widespread architectural style for inter application/service communication used by software applications. Underlying this style are many principles and constraints aimed at creating stateless, reliable APIs. When all REST constraints are met, APIs are also referred to as RESTful APIs. For cloud-based applications, REST APIs often communicate using the HTTP protocol, allowing interaction with application-specific data through requests to the corresponding URLs. The following API responses are often provided as JSON data, but are not limited to it.
::
#label-3
::GlobalTitle{:size="md" :tag="h4"}
How does gRPC work?
::
#text-3
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .leading-6}
GRPC works by allowing clients to make remote procedure calls (RPCs) to a server. The client sends a request message to the server containing the name of the method to be called, along with any parameters needed for the call. The server then processes the request and sends back a response message containing the results of the call. GRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts.
::
#label-4
::GlobalTitle{:size="md" :tag="h4"}
How do SOAP APIs work?
::
#text-4
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .leading-6}
A SOAP API works by sending and receiving messages in a standardized format. The messages are sent using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTP. The messages contain data that is encoded in XML format. The server then processes the message and sends a response back to the client.
::
#label-5
::GlobalTitle{:size="md" :tag="h4"}
How does GraphQL work?
::
#text-5
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .leading-6}
GraphQL works by allowing clients to make a single request to an API that specifies exactly what data they need. The server then processes the request and returns the requested data in a predictable format. GraphQL also allows developers to create powerful APIs with less code, making it easier to develop applications quickly and efficiently. GraphQL is used by many large companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub to power their services.

Using the right query language: GraphQL
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-3}
GraphQL is a query language, as well as a runtime, designed for APIs. The GraphQL service itself is transport agnostic, but it is often used in combination with HTTP. While GraphQL allows you full autonomy on how to build your APIs, its specification offers a number of design principles, which underline the ideas behind its development: GraphQL is product-centric and hierarchical. Its services are strongly-typed and are able to provide client-specific responses. Furthermore, a GraphQL service supports introspection over its schema. Taken together, this enables addressing issues such as over- and underfetching of data, as well as management of endpoints.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
One huge advantage of REST using HTTP, which GraphQL itself lacks, is the relatively easy way you can handle caching. REST web APIs have dedicated URLs that can be associated with specific response data, allowing to build caching solutions. GraphQL APIs, however, do not have a multitude of routes. This drawback is addressed by prominent GraphQL client solutions - such as the Apollo Client or Relay -, which besides caching provide additional useful functionality for your APIs.

OH NO, ANOTHER THING THAT NEEDS TESTING
::::
::::GlobalTitle{size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
Testing APIs at the core of your API first strategy
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
APIs need to be tested to ensure that they are secure, reliable, and perform as expected. Testing helps to identify any potential issues with an API before it is released into production. It also helps to ensure that the API meets the requirements of its users.
::::
::::GlobalTitle{size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
How can APIs be tested?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
APIs can be tested using a variety of methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing. Unit testing is used to test individual components of an API. Integration testing is used to test how different components of an API interact with each other. Functional testing is used to test the functionality of an API.

Good documentation makes it work
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
APIs need documentation so that developers and users can understand how to use the API and its endpoints. Documentation makes it easier for developers to quickly learn how to use an API, test and debug their applications, and build more complex integrations. It also helps users understand the capabilities of the API and how they can be used in their own applications.

Can API documentation be automated?
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
  Yes, API documentation can be automated using tools such as Swagger and OpenAPI. These tools allow developers to generate interactive API documentation from code, so that the documentation is always up-to-date with the latest changes in the API. This helps to ensure that developers have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the API.
