Simplify choosing your cloud provider

The cloud infrastructure that works for one organization likely won’t work for another—each organization is too unique in their needs and processes.

Cloud migration without headaches
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
There’s rarely a perfect provider match when migrating to the cloud or Kubernetes. We’ll help you sift through all providers and assess their different benefits and features. Blueshoe has many years of experience with complex architectures and infrastructures, cloud migration, cloud security, and optimizing development processes. Here’s how we determine the tools that will best suit your needs—then turn that determination into a reality.

Infrastructure & architecture analysis

:::GlobalBlock{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4 .ul-disk}
- **Location:** Is your business or data subject to certain geographic compliance laws like GDPR?
- **Compliance:** Is your business subject to compliance standards (i.e. HIPAA, ISO) that necessitate providers that also meet those standards? We’ll narrow down which providers excel in different security standards
- **Security:** How does a provider implement security measures like access controls, authentication, identity management, and where data is stored and/or processed?
- **Availability:** Which providers consistently deliver on 99.9%+ availability?
- **Reliability:** How quickly does a provider rectify downtime?
- **Certifications:** Does a provider come with certifications from the organizations most relevant to your needs?

To make life easier for you, we provide you with a comprehensive decision tree as a visual representation of the possible outcomes of your decision. It allows you to quickly identify the best option based on your criteria, and it can be used to evaluate multiple providers and compare different options. Additionally, it will help to identify potential risks and opportunities associated with each option.

WHAT IS CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
Cloud infrastructure is all the components needed to build and operate a cloud. Components include:
::::
::::GlobalBlock{.mb-4 .ul-disk}
- Storage
- Virtualization
- Network
- Hardware
::::
::::GlobalTitle{size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-6}
Why cloud infrastructure is important for business growth
::::
::::GlobalBlock{.mb-4 .ul-disk}
- With the right cloud services provider, your teams and business can:
- Save on costs
- Scale up IT resources quickly and cost effectively
- Enhance your [security](/our-services/cloud-security-services){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid}
- Harness valuable data insights
- Backup data automatically and recover from disasters faster
- Gain a competitive edge

Choosing the best cloud infrastructure
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" .mb-4}
It’s important to note first that the “best” cloud infrastructure for your organization will be unique. What your competitor uses likely won’t be exactly the same as what you need. (You don’t even know if their infrastructure is working for them or not!)
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" .mb-4}
Here are key factors in considering a cloud service provider. These are all factors that Blueshoe considers when putting together recommendations and a decision tree:
::::
#label-1
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Total cost of ownership
::
#text-1
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Ensure that the provider you choose not only meets your demands and requirements, but also falls within your budget.
::
#label-2
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Security
::
#text-2
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Select a provider with maturity in their security operations and security governance processes. Understand what your service provider is responsible for and what you are responsible for. Finally, look at their compliance standards, certifications, and internal security audit reports to ensure they live up to their stated standards.
::
#label-3
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Certification and standards
::
#text-3
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
You want to work with providers that adhere to recognized best practices and standards. Cloud certifications include NIST, SNI, and ISO. Security certifications include CSA, ISO, SSAE 16, and HIPAA. Operations certifications include ISO, ITIL, FitSM, and IFPUG.
::
#label-4
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Technology alignment
::
#text-4
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Do the provider’s cloud architectures, standards, and services match your management processes and workloads? Does the platform align with your environment and support both your business goals and cloud objectives?
::
#label-5
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Dependencies and vendor relationships
::
#text-5
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
A provider’s quality is only as good as its partnerships, so it’s important that providers partner with vendors that are accredited, capable, and certified. If they work with many levels of subcontractors, that can put the provider’s—and by extension, your—security and data governance at risk.
::
#label-6
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Reliability and availability
::
#text-6
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
You want to work with providers that have as little downtime as possible. If a provider doesn’t publish their performance over the past year, they can furnish it upon request. The provider should also have customer communication plans documented to alert customers to timelines and security assessments.
::
#label-7
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :size="sm" :tag="h4"}
Ease of exit
::
#text-7
::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" :fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Leaving a cloud service provider is not always easy, so before setting a contract, it’s important to understand the process of exiting a contract, how you will get access to your data, and how long a provider will keep that data.
::

:::GlobalSectionWithImage{:image="/img/services/data_1.svg" :alt="data" :bg="bg-white" :imagePosition="left" :isButton=false data-title="When should I choose a cloud provider?"}
::::GlobalTitle{.mb-6}
When should I choose a cloud provider?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Ensuring your cloud provider relationship will be beneficial to your business will require a lot of forethought and planning. There are seemingly endless aspects to consider, and Blueshoe’s experience in helping businesses plan and implement a cloud migration ensures these aspects are never overlooked.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Before you start looking at cloud providers, have a checklist of your requirements, not the features that cloud providers say are important. When you can compare against your own business benchmarks and requirements, it’s easier to select the best cloud provider for your needs.

We built a whole platform and infrastructure for automated seminar and webinar management. Including consent management, connection to existing systems and interfaces to external applications such as Go2Webinar. All of it is built on a service based architecture and runs on Kubernetes. The whole platform runs on highly automated processes for development and deployment.

We did a full technical overhaul of the Winter&Company Website building it on a microservice based architecture that runs on top of Kubernetes. We integrated fully automated CI/CD pipelines and also by using a proven set of tools and therefore drastically increased development speed and release cycles.
