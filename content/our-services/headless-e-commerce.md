What does headless e-commerce mean?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
The term ‘headless’ comes from IT architecture and indicates that **frontend and backend** do not strictly belong together anymore but are in fact **separated from one another.** Back in the day, the visualisation of content and the corresponding data of an online shop were closely linked. In the course of cloud-native development, the two areas are operating in an increasingly separated manner.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
It’s precisely this approach that the headless commerce technology pursues, too: front end and back end function independently from one another, communicate with each other via interfaces (API) and can be combined with different headless components. This also means **that individual components can easily be swapped or customised.**

WHY CHOOSE HEADLESS E-COMMERCE
::::
::::GlobalTitle{.mb-6}
Faster, higher, further!
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
The requirements of a modern online shop are high! **Fast performance, intuitive interfaces and the management of huge amounts of data** are just some of the challenges that a modern e-commerce system has to face.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
The complexity in the area of online commerce has increased steadily in recent years. The desire for individualisation has similarly increased. Furthermore, a shop owner constantly has to **react to market changes, trends and customer requests.**

The benefits of headless e-commerce
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{:color="text-white" .mb-6}
If you want to create an online shop that’s customised to your own needs and covers several different channels, a headless e-commerce system might just be the thing for you. The headless technology also improves the shop performance and user experience (UX).

Extremely easy extensibility
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
The modular concept allows for flexible extensions without the need to interfere with the e-commerce’s core every time, which would put the back end’s stability at risk.

#card2
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4}
Faster loading times, better UX
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
With headless e-commerce, the data is sent straight to the front end via the respective interface (API). This means no more data build-up and therefore fewer clients who will stop their buying journey during check-out.

One shop & many different channels
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
All contents and products are stored in a central place and optimised for the respective end device and channel (apps, social media, marketplace etc.). This makes the expansion to additional sales channels super easy.

Why is Blueshoe your expert for headless e-commerce?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-3}
At Blueshoe, we have made the conscious choice to live by the native-first principle. The logical consequence? Individual headless e-commerce systems. We connect independent components with one another and create online shops that react to market trends and our client’s wishes in a flexible manner.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Shop components (like the search, check-out or product display) have to be compatible with one another via interfaces – not much more! Everything else can be developed individually. And that’s where we come in.
