Within this blog post, I discuss the benefits and necessity of using application feedback to tackle basic aspects of service availability. The framework used to elaborate the concepts is Kubernetes. However, the underlying ideas are transferable and not limited to Kubernetes. Furthermore, while the use of probes (health check) allows us to tackle basic availability aspects, there are many more aspects of (high) availability which are not mentioned within this article.
