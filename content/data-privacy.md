:::
:::globalParagraph{.mb-4}
Our provider uses this information for the dispatch and statistical evaluation of the newsletter on our behalf. For the evaluation the sent emails contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which are one-pixel image files stored on our website. In this way it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on, if applicable. Conversion tracking can also be used to analyse whether a predefined action (e.g. purchase of a product on our website) was carried out after clicking on the link in the newsletter. Technical information is also recorded (e.g. time of access, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data is collected pseudonymously and is not linked to your other personal data, a direct personal reference is excluded. These data are used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR, which you give in the course of the newsletter registration.
:::
:::globalParagraph{.mb-6}
If you wish to revoke your consent to data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.
