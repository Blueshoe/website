What do we understand by “tooling” for software development?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Tooling in software development is the set of tools used to develop, deploy, and manage applications. This includes tools for source code management (e.g. Git), development (e.g. Gefyra), build automation (e.g. GitHub Actions), continuous integration/delivery (e.g. ArgoCD), container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes), monitoring (e.g Prometheus and Grafana), and more. Tooling is important because it helps streamline and standardize the development process and ensure that applications are deployed and managed efficiently, reducing errors during development and improving security.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Additionally, having the right tools in place can help provide visibility into the health and performance of applications as well as automate tasks such as deployment, configuration management, and service mesh management.

Kubernetes configurations
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Kubernetes configuration files are files that contain the settings and parameters used to define how applications are deployed and managed in a Kubernetes cluster. These files can be written in YAML or JSON and typically contain information such as resource requests, limits, labels, annotations, and more. Configuration files can be used to store configurations for multiple applications or services in a single file. Besides writing plain YAML files, Blueshoe supports you with writing Kubernetes configurations using Helm and Kustomize. From scratch, or driving existing projects on Kubernetes, Blueshoe provides deep expertise in bringing workloads to Kubernetes efficiently and securely.

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps simplify the deployment and management of applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating, updating, and managing Kubernetes configurations. Additionally, Helm can be used to automate the deployment process and quickly roll back changes if necessary. Finally, Helm can be used to share configurations with other developers or teams, making it easier to collaborate on projects. Blueshoe’s experts have a long standing experience in writing Helm charts for many different use-cases. If you need help with your workload managament using Helm, get in touch.

Kustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating, updating, and managing Kubernetes configurations. Additionally, Kustomize can be used to automate the deployment process and quickly roll back changes if necessary. Finally, Kustomize can be used to share configurations with other developers or teams, making it easier to collaborate on projects. If you need help in consolidating your Kubernetes workloads for dev, staging and production environment, Blueshoe is your partner.

Monitoring your Kubernetes Infrastructure
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
It is important to monitor the Kubernetes infrastructure because it provides visibility into the health and performance of applications. This helps ensure that applications are running as expected and can alert administrators if there are any issues. Additionally, monitoring can help identify potential security risks and provide insights into how applications are being used.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
There are a variety of software tools for Kubernetes monitoring, including Prometheus, Grafana, Kube-state-metrics, and Heapster. These tools can be used to monitor the health and performance of applications in real-time. Additionally, there are other tools such as Istio and Linkerd that can be used to manage service meshes. Depending on your use-cases, Blueshoe will advise you with the right monitoring solution and implement it according to your needs.

Gefyra
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
<a href="https://gefyra.dev/" target="_blank" class="text-bs-blue hover:underline hover:decoration-bs-blue hover:decoration-solid">Gefyra</a> allows developers to “bridge” a locally running container into a Kubernetes cluster. Either a dedicated development cluster (provided with Getdeck) or any pre-production system can be used. Gefyra connects the developer’s machine (Windows, MacOS or Linux) with the selected environment and makes Kuberntes-based resources (such as data layers, other services, Kubernetes API-extensions) available to the developers code - no more break between development and production environment - No more time-consuming back and forth with the integration system. If you need support for your developers, Blueshoe is here to help.

Getdeck
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-3}
Use the Kubernetes configurations that you already have for your production environment and simply roll them out to your developers. <a href="https://getdeck.dev/" target="_blank" class="text-bs-blue hover:underline hover:decoration-bs-blue hover:decoration-solid">Getdeck</a> allows you to pull all components together and provide a developer with an individual development environment that matches production. Remove that “works on my machine” and standardize the development environments across all development teams. If you already have members in your team putting a lot of effort in writing secure, compliant and off-the-shelf Kubernetes workloads, why don't you use (at least parts of it) these for development, too? Get in touch with Blueshoe to find out how your development team can benefit from using Getdeck today.
