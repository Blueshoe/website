# Job Description: Software Architect

## Mission
Blueshoe's software architects speak two languages: customer requirements and technical solutions. Your main job is to translate between these in either direction. A software architect creates software concepts for long-lasting and rock-solid products from functional and non-functional requirements. Software architects are crucial for the customer’s success. Your output describes precisely what software engineers are going to realize. You can explain the results and positively impact all aspects of the development process.

## Functions you contribute to

### Function: Software Architecting
Software architecting is an ongoing function: before and during a product's development and maintenance phase. Therefore, a software architect is important in all product life cycle stages.

* You conduct customer meetings (you speak with customers on a non-technical level)
* You understand the business model and context of our customer
* You are willing to change the perspective of the customer to create the most valuable solution
* You create a software solution that meets the requirements precisely but without additional interpretation
   * Make software design decisions

   * Identify technical road blockers and help overcome them 
   * Identify opportunities (about skill, standards, development, business improvements)
   * Make sure all team members take part in the discussions
### Function: Practice Development

Practice development is an interdisciplinary function that flows orthogonal to the operational work. We regularly intersect technical and non-technical aspects of product development to create and adapt standard procedures within our teams.

### Responsibilities and Tasks
* You coach teams to deliver the best possible output 
* You define technical and non-technical standards for our product development and maintenance work
   * Standard software development procedures
   * Standard general-purpose software components (especially for recurring requirements)

   * Find an appropriate form for documentation and presentation
   * Collect feedback from team members

   * A mismatch between staffing and required skill
   * Documentation
* You actively gatekeep projects between the realization and ongoing maintenance phase
