::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Workflow automation is of interest to many different stakeholders in software development projects. From a business perspective, the most obvious reason is financial: automation enables significant cost savings.

Let’s break it down
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-6}
Many processes can be broken down into a well-orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activities required to complete them. These types of activity patterns are called workflows, which workflow automation aims to automate. Thus, the main focus of workflow automation is to eliminate all human interactions by streamlining tasks and activities. In this way, manual errors are avoided, repetitive tasks are automated, and work gets done faster.

Automation for developers
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
From a cloud application developer perspective workflow automation is extremely important as it is of central importance to primary practices of modern development philosophies: including fast development cycles, short builds and continuous integration. Thus, if you or your organization aim to develop modern, maintainable, high quality cloud applications, you will inevitably be confronted with workflow automation. Most likely you already have heard of it in the form of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) pipelines.

Continuous Integration (CI)
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
Continuous integration can be viewed as a feedback mechanism that provides information about the integrability of code changes. To avoid "integration hell," modern development approaches often aim to integrate code quickly and often. Continuous integration automates the testing process before and during integration, providing developers with important feedback on the functionality of code changes. In addition to various types of tests, automated static code analysis and security aspects can also be integrated within the continuous integration pipeline.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
After successful integration, continuous delivery automates the creation and release of software applications. This part is pure automation that aims to have a current version of the application available for deployment at all times. Continuous Deployment goes one step further and automatically deploys the latest versions to the desired environment. In this way, code changes can be made available to customers within minutes. This dramatically reduces the time it takes for new features and bug fixes to create business value. In addition, the feedback loop between developer and customer is accelerated so that solutions can be optimally tailored to the customer's needs.

No automation without tools
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Our philosophy has at its core, that we use tools wherever possible. Ideally something really specialized for every part in the chain. In fact, we have been developing in so many different environments over the last years, that we feel like we tried all of them already and have a very broad understanding of which tool works for which requirements.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
And all of this also sometimes led to us developing our own open source tools, when we just couldn’t find the right match.

Setting up our customer projects according to the cloud-native approach helps us to develop complex systems quickly and efficiently and to implement short, efficient release cycles. The following projects are a small excerpt from our past cloudnative projects.

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
We built a whole platform and infrastructure for automated seminar and webinar management. Including consent management, connection to existing systems and interfaces to external applications such as Go2Webinar. All of it is built on a service based architecture and runs on Kubernetes. The whole platform runs on highly automated processes for development and deployment.
