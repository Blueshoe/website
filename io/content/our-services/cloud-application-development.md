Why do you need a cloud application development agency?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
As your cloud application development agency, we strongly believe in the benefits of cloud applications that enable you to make your applications more reliable, scalable and manageable - all while reducing overall costs. We see cloud applications as an opportunity that allows you to focus on your product, service or idea. Why spend your time on technical details that have already been solved and optimized by others? Instead, we help you to take full advantage of cloud applications.

What are cloud applications?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Cloud applications are software components that are at least partially deployed in a cloud environment and are generally accessed primarily over the Internet. When developing and deploying cloud applications, you're not forced to expose your applications to everyone on the internet. Depending on your [security](/our-services/cloud-security-services){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid} and [infrastructure](/our-services/cloud-infrastructure-consulting){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid} needs, you can choose to have more or less control over the used infrastructure/hardware by deciding for private, public, hybrid or even multi-cloud solutions. Furthermore, proven authentication and authorization solutions allow you to control access to applications as you wish and require.
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
For most organizations and applications, the public cloud is the solution of choice, no matter whether the application is to be used internally, externally, or both. Known cloud providers, such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Hetzner offer flexible storage capabilities, computing power, networking capabilities and many additional services at low rates. You can scale as you require. Even if your company policies or regulations prohibit the usage of services of these companies, there are often alternative [cloud providers which match your requirements.](/our-services/cloud-infrastructure-consulting){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid}

Cloud-native application development vs. standard application development
::::
::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
The advantages of cloud-native applications over standard applications are founded by the usage of the cloud as well as the approach of application development itself. Check out the following article, to learn more about the evolution of application development.

::::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" .mb-6}
Advantages of the cloud approach
::::
#card1
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4 }
Cost Reduction:
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
Especially when using public cloud providers, you only pay for what you use - basically you rent your infrastructure. Thus, cloud applications require minimal or no upfront investment in IT infrastructure. You are free of having to purchase and maintain any hardware related equipment. No servers, no administration, no power consumption, air conditioning, upgrades, defects or any operation related costs.
::
#card2
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4}
Scalability:
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
You can easily and fast scale your cloud applications up or down in response to changed user demand. Again, you can rely on your cloud provider to handle the infrastructure. You simply have to request more compute power, which often is available within minutes. It can even be possible to automatically scale your cloud applications depending on resource usage.
::
#card3
::GlobalTitle{:color="text-white" :tag="h3" :size="lg" .mb-4}
Reliability:
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" :color="text-white"}
Cloud providers are experts in managing infrastructure. They have more cloud resources and expertise available than most companies. They achieve high reliability and uptime which would be hard to match by maintaining similar resources on-site.

Advantages of cloud-native applications
::::
#card1
::GlobalTitle{:size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-4}
Accessibility:
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
Cloud applications can rely on computing power and storage capacity within the cloud. They can even be built to consume very little computing power and almost no storage space on a local device. Thus, you can provide cloud applications which might have resource requirements which are exceeding resources available by most users. All the heavy lifting is done remotely.
::
#card2
::GlobalTitle{:size="lg" :tag="h3" .mb-4}
Software updates:
::
::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
As cloud applications do not require local installations, they can be updated whenever you have new features or bug fixes. Hereby users might not even realize that you have rolled out a new verson, since they do not have to manually confirm updates or wait for them to finish. You can drastically increase the release cycle of your applications. Yes, you can release new versions several times a day.

As your custom software development agency, we specialize in providing custom-made software solutions that perfectly solve your use case. We will not hesitate to suggest the use of standard solutions when possible. However, experience shows that these are often not the right solution for a particular problem or especially for your future vision for your application. When developing applications for you, we remain agile, delivering incremental progress and staying in constant communication with you. With our experience and expertise in cloud application development, we deliver solutions that can be deployed directly into the cloud. In fact, we often strive to develop applications directly in the cloud or in cloud-like configurations to ensure functionality and compatibility. Contact us for more information on our approach.
