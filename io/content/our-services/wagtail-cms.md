Open-source CMS & modern user interface
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
The open-source CMS Wagtail would probably not exist if it weren’t for Python and Django. Wagtail is heavily focused on progress and is constantly being optimised. Even Google works with Wagtail. You currently simply cannot get a more modern CMS.

Speed, creativity & progress
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
Wagtail is just as attractive to developers as it is to authors. What’s more, the respective website’s end consumer receives the best possible experience, because thanks to Wagtail, the front-end designer can express their creativity to the fullest. Additionally, thanks to the ‘headless approach’, there are almost no loading times.

Python & django = Blueshoe

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
Wagtail is based on the Django framework and therefore also on Python as the programming language – both of which we work with the most. [Python and Django are the heart of our software development.](/our-services/python-django-agency){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid} And this is where our expertise lies.

Three strong arguments: flex, flex, flex

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg"}
We love Django CMS for its flexibility – and Wagtail is just as flexible. With Wagtail, headless architecture and a static site approach are easy to implement. And that’s just how we like it.

For Hamburg University of Technology, we created the ‘Digital Learning Hub’, a platform for the digital creation of teaching materials. Teachers and lecturers from all over Germany can use digital tools and teaching materials for their own (distance learning) classes. We decided to implement a headless approach using Wagtail CMS and building the platform on top of Kubernetes.

We did a full technical overhaul of the Winter&Company Website building it on a microservice based architecture that runs on top of Kubernetes. We used a headless approach working with Wagtail CMS and are generating static pages in the frontend which makes the website very fast. Dynamic content is being loaded via an [API](/our-services/api-development-company/){.text-bs-blue .hover:underline .hover:decoration-bs-blue .hover:decoration-solid}.

Allianz offer their network partners a variety of products and services in order to secure the future of their employees. For Allianz Global Benefits, we created a B2B platform with a headless CMS which scales the complexity and simultaneously offers the best local and global solutions. The whole platform is build for and deployed on an Open Shift Kubernetes setup provided by Allianz.
