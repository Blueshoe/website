Cloud native software development
::::
::::GlobalTitle{.mb-6 data-title="Method"}
As unique as your demands
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
Individual tasks and complex requirements need precisely fitting software. We believe that in software development not every proverbial nail can be hammered with the same hammer. We analyze very precisely what your basic goal is and specify the planned result of your project together with you. We then design individual solutions according to your requirements, making efficient use of our resources and know-how. This also means that we use already existing solutions where it makes sense.

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="text-lg" .mb-4}
The foundation for any web project is a solid infrastructure. It ensures that the application runs stably and can process the requests that arise. A good infrastructure automatically scales the performance needed for the current task. What used to be a Herculean task is many times easier in times of cloud infrastructure.
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Own physical server facilities are no longer needed today. But simply cloud will not suffice as an answer. Modern services like Docker and Kubernetes are needed to control and develop applications efficiently.
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
We rely on cloud native development based on Kubernetes and Docker and are more than happy with it.

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Under the hood of every good web application beats backend technology that ensures that users can use the functions they see on the frontend. You could describe the backend as the engine room of an application. For us, it's important to rely on modern backend technologies that we really know our way around.
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
For us, this means that we don't make any technological compromises. We rely on Python as a basic programming language and specifically on django, a Python framework, to develop functions.
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
The django framework makes it possible to develop complex backends without having to reinvent the wheel every time for basic functions.

:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
Front-end development has become extremely complex over the last 20 years. Whereas in the past you only developed for one or two browsers and only for the desktop, today frontends have to work in many different screen sizes and browsers, which are then also in circulation in different versions.
:::
:::GlobalParagraph{:fontSize="lg" .mb-4}
To create a coherent user experience, we rely on a fixed technology stack that has proven itself over the last few years when it comes to creating modern interfaces that can then also be displayed flawlessly across the board.
