The Code Monolith Monster

::::GlobalParagraph{.mb-4}
Built an application 10 years ago that is now a code monolith monster? Every feature development now takes forever. The code is so old that none of the original team members are around anymore. And every bug fix is like playing Whack-a-Mole?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
We know and can fix that. We transform your monolith into a service architecture and prepare you for the future.

Why is Blueshoe your expert for the path to service architecture?
::::
::::GlobalParagraph
We are fans of flexible solutions - we want to quickly launch new features and build systems that don't turn bug fixing into a nightmare. We have learned this the hard way and paid a lot of tuition. We now know what a system looks like that can be developed well, thanks to our extensive experience from many projects. We have migrated many legacy systems, including very large ones, to modern architectures. Therefore, we come with a lot of experience and a strong desire to dust off older projects and make them fit for the coming years.
